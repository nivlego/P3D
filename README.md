# P3D
Programming for 3D module Repo


Hello!

In an unfortunate case, the materials and meshes used for my scene are much too large to put up as a standard file. I will be uploading simply a link to a google drive.7z zipped file, containing the entire project, with other zipped files inside. One will be soley for assets, one will be for all other details, and one solely for a build. 

Please extract them all so that Assets, Build, Library, Logs, Obj, Packages, ProjectSettings, Resources, UserSettings, Assembly-CSharp.csproj, gude-2023-01-12.log and p3d.sln are all in the same level.

To reiterate: There will be 3 .7z files. "Assets.7z", "Build.7z" and "p3d.7z". These 3 should all be on the same level when extracted, as assets contains only assets, build contains only build, but p3d contains all other important files for a project to run.
