# P3D
Programming for 3D module Repo


Hello!

In an unfortunate case, the materials and meshes used for my scene are much too large to put up as a standard file. I will be uploading simply a link to a google drive.7z zipped file, containing the entire project, with other zipped files inside. One will be soley for assets, one will be for all other details, and one solely for a build. 

Please extract them all so that Assets, Build, Library, Logs, Obj, Packages, ProjectSettings, Resources, UserSettings, Assembly-CSharp.csproj, gude-2023-01-12.log and p3d.sln are all in the same level.
